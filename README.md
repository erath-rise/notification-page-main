## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- responsive design
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [TailWindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework

### What I learned

- Uses the useState hook to manage notification list
- Calculates the number of unread notifications.
- Uses the map function to iterate through notificationsData and render a Notification component for each notification.
- Uses Tailwind CSS class names for styling.
- Responsive design to adapt to different screen sizes (mobile and desktop).

### Continued development

- Implement sorting options (e.g., by date, unread first)
- Add pagination or infinite scrolling for large numbers of notifications
- Add a search functionality to filter notifications
